This codebase is derived from ocrodjvu from https://github.com/jwilk/ocrodjvu

I have limited it to just the code required for hocr2djvused, and updated that 
code to support python 3. I looked into upgrading the entire codebase, but the 
intricacies of unicode support, etc, meant it was a significant and I only need 
hocr2djvused for my use-case.

Like the original, my updates are released under the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE 
Version 2.
